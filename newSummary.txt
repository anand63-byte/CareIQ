MediInsight Project Summary:

1. **Frontend Features**:
   - **Upload Report**: Users can upload medical reports in PDF or image format. The system processes the files to extract text using OCR (Tesseract.js) or PDF parsing.
   - **View and Download Reports**: Users can view and download uploaded reports, including photos and PDFs, directly from the interface.
   - **Prescription Decode**: Extracts and summarizes prescription details, including medications, dosage, and instructions.
   - **Medicine Decode**: Extracts and provides detailed information about medicines, including brand name, generic name, dosage, side effects, and more.
   - **Report Analysis**: Summarizes key findings, abnormal results, critical points, and follow-up actions from medical reports using AI.
   - **Doctor Interaction**: Users can add or remove doctors and share reports with them.

2. **Backend Features**:
   - **User Authentication**: Secure user and doctor authentication using JWT tokens.
   - **File Processing**:
     - Image files are processed using Tesseract.js for OCR.
     - PDF files are parsed using `pdf-parse` to extract text.
   - **AI Integration**:
     - Google GenAI is used to analyze medical reports and generate structured summaries.
     - AI models provide JSON-formatted responses for easy integration.
   - **Database**:
     - MongoDB is used to store user data, reports, and doctor-patient relationships.
     - Reports include text, photo (Base64-encoded), and PDF data (binary).
   - **APIs**:
     - Endpoints for uploading reports, decoding prescriptions, analyzing reports, and managing users and doctors.

3. **Key Technologies**:
   - **Frontend**: React, Tailwind CSS, Axios.
   - **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Tesseract.js, Google GenAI.
   - **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with cookies.

4. **Deployment**:
   - The frontend is built using Vite and served as static files.
   - The backend serves APIs and handles static file requests for the frontend.

5. **Future Enhancements**:
   - Improve AI accuracy for report analysis and medicine decoding.
   - Add support for additional file types and languages.
   - Enhance the user interface for better accessibility and usability.
